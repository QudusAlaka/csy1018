1.	Identify what aspects of work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

Before I started the main coding of the pages I made sure that I drew up a mock up of the 
site so that I knew roughly what the site would look like and I could make sure all the 
aspects which were stated in brief were implemented effectively such as the image on the 
Index.html page, I done this by implementing the <img> tag this allowed me to import the 
image. I also made used of the < div > tag in order for me to group the image so that I could 
style them in the CSS styling file, the styling which I used for the image is a border which
has a width of 52%, padding of 10 px & the color was #666633 which is dark yellow in html. 
I thought this was a good idea as the picture needed to stand out from the main background. 
Also on all the pages I made sure I kept the same color scheme & page dimensions the same 
which was a dark pink color background, a grey navigation bar & the page width was 1250px 
and the height was 154px. The navigation bar was used as a clean way to implement the links 
to the various pages such as CV.html, BIO.html & CONTACT.html. the navigation bar was created 
by using the < li > & < ul > tags so that I could create a list of the various page links in bullet 
point, then afterwards in the CSS styling I edited the bullet points so that they could all be 
in a specific color on one line. The navigation bar is also styled so that once a page has been 
clicked a the page link stays white whilst the rest remain gray this will allow the browser to
know what page they are currently on this was done by me adding a new class called active to 
each <li> tag on their appropriate pages which will set each link to #444 once clicked. 
Another aspect of work which was implemented was the static form in the CONTACT.html page, 
this was basic form which included a submit button that gave the user the chance to insert 
their information and leave a short message so that they could be contacted on a later date. 
This static form was implemented by using the < form > tag which is widely used in HTML to 
create html forms for user input, I also made use of the <textarea> tag in order to create 
the multi-line input text area for the short message box as the <texarea> tag can hold an 
unlimited number of characters. The only aspect of work that I personally think I never 
implemented was the use of Google UI style guide as it wasnâ€™t really straightforward to 
understand & I had a basic knowledge of coding websites already
